# 1 MAGNN
This repo is the official implementation for Multi-Scale Adaptive Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.

## 1.1 The framework of MAGNN
 ![framework](https://github.com/shangzongjiang/MAGNN/blob/main/fig/2.png)

# 2 Prerequisites

* Python 3.6.12
* PyTorch 1.0.0
* math, sklearn, numpy
# 3 Datasets
To evaluate the performance of MAGNN, we conduct experiments on [four public benchmark datasets](https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data)ï¼šSolar-Energy, Traffic, Electricity, and Exchange-Rate.
## 3.1 Solar-Energy
This dataset contains the collected solar power from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which is sampled every 10 minutes from 137 PV plants in Alabama State in 2007.
## 3.2 Traffic
This dataset contains the road occupancy rates (between 0 and 1) from the California Department of Transportation, which is hourly aggregated from 862 sensors in San Francisco Bay Area from 2015 to 2016.
## 3.3 Electricity
This dataset contains the electricity consumption from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is hourly aggregated from 321 clients from 2012 to 2014.
## 3.4 Exchange-Rate
This dataset contains the exchange rates of eight countries, which is sampled daily from 1990 to 2016.
